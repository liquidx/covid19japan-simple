There are four main values:

 * New Cases (confirmed)
 * New Deaths (deceased)
 * Active Cases (patients that are still testing positive)
 * Critical Cases (patients that are active AND in critical condition)

 The first two are differential values, the latter two are instaneous numbers.

So they need to be displayed differently.
